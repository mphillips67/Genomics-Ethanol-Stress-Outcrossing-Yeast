Scripts used to estimate selection coefficients based on changes in SNP frequencies over time in each treatment group. Ne estimates were made using the pool-seq package in R (https://github.com/ThomasTaus/poolSeq) and S estiamtes using the Bait-ER (https://github.com/mrborges23/Bait-ER). Inputs for BaitER were created by taking relevant portions of the SNP table available through Dryad and converting them to sync format. Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 5 require response category lists (see Candidate SNP Identification directory).
