Scripts used to estimate selection coefficients based on changes in SNP frequencies over time in each treatment group. Ne estimates were made using the pool-seq package in R (https://github.com/ThomasTaus/poolSeq) and S estiamtes using the Bait-ER (https://github.com/mrborges23/Bait-ER). Inputs for BaitER were created by taking relevant portions of the SNP table available through Dryad and converting them to sync format (the sync files themselves are also available through dryad). Also of note, based on communcations with creators of Bait-ER, calculations were using "raw" SNP table where sites were not scaled to a uniform coverage.
