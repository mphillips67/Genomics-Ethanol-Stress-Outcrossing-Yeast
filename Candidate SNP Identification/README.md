Here are the scripts used to peform CMH and GLMM analyses. The CMH tests was used for within treatment comparisons (e.g. C replicates cycle 1 versus cycle 15), while the GLMM approach was used for between treatment comparisons (e.g. C replicates vs. H replicates). Also, included are scripts to run the permutations used to establish significance thresholds. Once comparisons and permutations are done, the "list creation" scripts can be used to be lists of differentiated sites from each comparison.
