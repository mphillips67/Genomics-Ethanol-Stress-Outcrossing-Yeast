Here are files to compare growth rate data for different treatments and ancestral population in plain YPD, 6% ethnaol ypd, and 10% ethanol ypd. Input files, and r scripts for statistical comparions and plotting data are included. 

"Eth_48_hr_timepoint_0.txt" contains data from a plate reader assay measuring  growth in the ancestral population across all media types for 48 hours. 

"Plain_ypd_2021.txt": contains data from plate reader assay measuring  growth in the ancestral population and experimental populations during cycle 15 in plain YPD. 

"Moderate_ypd_2021.txt": contains data from plate reader assay measuring  growth in the ancestral population and experimental populations during cycle 15 in 6% ethanol YPD. 

"High_ypd_2021.txt": contains data from plate reader assay measuring  growth in the ancestral population and experimental populations during cycle 15 in 10% ethanol YPD.
