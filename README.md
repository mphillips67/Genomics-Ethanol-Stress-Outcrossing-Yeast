*"Strength of selection potentiates distinct adaptive responses in an evolution experiment with outcrossing yeast"* (DOI will be provided upon publication). 

## Repository contents

- **Scripts**: All scripts needed to reproduce the major analyses and figures in the manuscript.
- **Folder organization**:
  - Each folder contains scripts associated with each specific type of analysis.
  - Folder names on GitHub correspond to the Dryad folders containing their respective input/output data.
  - Many of the genomic analyses require the filtered SNP table
  - In particular, the file **`SNPtable_50X_scaled.txt`** is required for many of the analyses and is available through Dryad.

## Data availability

-Major input and output files associated with these scripts are available through Dryad (DOI will be made available upon publication).
